# WASM vs React.js Performance Comparison Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for implementing a performance comparison between WebAssembly (WASM) and pure React.js implementations of the same UI components. The goal is to measure and compare the performance characteristics of both approaches.

## Route Structure

- `/` - Home page with navigation to both implementations
- `/wasm` - WebAssembly implementation (moved from existing code)
- `/react` - Pure React.js implementation (new)

## Component Implementation

### WASM Implementation
- Move the existing implementation to the WASM route
- Utilize the `RustProductGrid` component which loads and renders via WebAssembly
- Add performance measurement instrumentation

### React Implementation
- Clone all components from the WASM implementation
- Replace `RustProductGrid` with the existing pure React `ProductGrid` component
- Ensure identical styling and functionality
- Add the same performance measurement instrumentation

## Performance Metrics

We will implement a comprehensive set of performance measurements:

### Rendering Metrics
- Initial page load time
- Component mount/update time
- Time to interactive

### Memory Usage
- Track heap size using `performance.memory` API (where supported)
- Memory allocation patterns during interactions

### Interaction Performance
- Measure response time for pagination actions
- Measure response time for adding items to cart
- Track frame rate during animations/transitions

## Performance Dashboard

A performance dashboard component will be included on both routes to:
- Display real-time metrics
- Show comparison charts between implementations
- Allow exporting performance data for analysis

## Implementation Steps

1. Create the route structure and navigation
   - Set up directory structure for App Router routes
   - Create navigation component
   - Update the home page

2. Move existing WASM implementation
   - Move code to the WASM route
   - Refactor as needed

3. Create React implementation
   - Clone and adapt components
   - Ensure identical styling and functionality

4. Implement performance measurement
   - Create utility functions for metrics collection
   - Add instrumentation to both implementations

5. Add performance dashboard
   - Create shared component for metrics display
   - Add to both routes

6. Test and validate
   - Verify both implementations work correctly
   - Validate metrics collection
   - Compare performance characteristics

## Technical Considerations

- Both implementations must be visually identical
- Both must use the same data source and API calls
- Performance metrics should be collected in a consistent manner
- The measurement process itself should not significantly impact performance
