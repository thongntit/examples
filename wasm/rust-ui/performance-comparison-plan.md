# Performance Comparison: React vs React+Dioxus Product Listing Page

## 1. Project Overview

We'll build two versions of a product listing page with identical functionality but different implementation approaches:

1. **React-Only Version**: A Next.js application where all components are built using React
2. **Hybrid Version**: A Next.js application where the product grid is implemented in Rust using Dioxus and compiled to WebAssembly

Both implementations will use vanilla CSS for styling to ensure a fair comparison without additional library overhead.

```mermaid

    subgraph "React-Only Implementation"
    A1[Next.js Application] --> B1[React Components]
    B1 --> C1[Product Grid]
    B1 --> D1[Search Bar]
    B1 --> E1[Cart Summary]
    end
    
    subgraph "Hybrid Implementation"
    A2[Next.js Application] --> B2[React Components]
    B2 --> C2[Dioxus WebAssembly Product Grid]
    B2 --> D2[React Search Bar]
    B2 --> E2[React Cart Summary]
    end
```

## 2. Feature Requirements

Both implementations will include:

- **Search Bar**: Real-time filtering as the user types
- **Product Grid**: 
  - Displays 1000+ products (name, price, image, "Add to Cart" button)
  - Supports pagination
  - Responsive layout
- **Cart Summary**: Updates when products are added to cart
- **Mock Data**: At least 1000 realistic product entries

    Cart->>Cart: Re-renders with updated items
```
